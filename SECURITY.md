# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Chhaya is still evolving rapidly. We provide security fixes for the actively
developed `main` branch and the most recent published release line. Older
releases should be upgraded as soon as possible to stay covered by patches and
protocol hardening updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| `main`  | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the Chhaya network seriously. Please report suspected
vulnerabilities or weaknesses privately so we can investigate and roll out a
fix before public disclosure.

1. Use GitHub report vulnerability button with a concise description of the issue,
   including steps to reproduce, the impacted components (for example: `p2p`,
   `vkd`, or `logstore`), and any proof-of-concept material. Do not open a
   public GitHub issue for security reports.

2. Expect an initial acknowledgement during the upcoming weekend after we
   receive your report. We will provide follow-up status updates each weekend
   until the issue is resolved.

3. After verification, we will coordinate a fix, prepare any necessary security
   advisories, and agree on a disclosure timeline that balances remediation and
   user safety. Credit will be given unless you request anonymity.


If you believe the vulnerability affects third-party ecosystems (for example,
upstream crates we depend on), please mention this so we can coordinate a joint
response.

Thank you for helping us keep the Chhaya protocol secure for everyone.
